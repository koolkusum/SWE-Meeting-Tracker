# SWE-Meeting-Tracker

## 2023 RIEEE Hackathon

Used a local server to host the website (using XAMPP). We primarily coded the website in HTML, CSS, PHP. PHP was used to interact with our database.

I suggest looking at the write up on https://devpost.com/software/the-best-swe-meeting-tracker to full understand how to project functions.

KoolKusum: my commits don't show because I had the wrong email address connected to my git bash.
